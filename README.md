# IRIS Tello Demo

Part of Project Vanguard's Fall 2020 Semester Projects, IRIS focused on providing a scalable machine learning model for object detection, that would serve as a demo for the features implemented on the team's main line of drones.

### How it Works

The Tello will carry out code running on a host computer connected to the broadcasting wifi signal coming from the drone itself. Through this network, the aircraft will execute receiving commands using UDP.

Using the Tello SDK User Guide, as soon as the ML model detects a specified object in the input Tello video stream, it will send the Tello a command. The model uses the following classes:

background, aeroplane, bicycle, bird, boat, bottle, bus, car, cat, chair, cow,
diningtable, dog, horse, motorbike, person, pottedplant, sheep, sofa, train, tvmonitor

The bottle object is being used to carry out the demo. Once the object is detected, the *flip right* flip r, command is sent to the drone.

send("flip r")
